# AC-Heater-System
AC/heater system created in MPlabxIDE using C. This program utilizes the pic18f4620's timers, interrupts, pulse width modulations (PWM), Capture-compare modes. An asynchronous remote controller is incorporated to manipulate date, time, timer, and heat values. The remote controller interacts with the on chip's Master Synchronous Serial Port (MSSP).
Directions:
1. Download mplabxide
2. select the pic18f4620 and simulator
